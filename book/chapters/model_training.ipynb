Unlike traditional decision trees, which split the data by selecting the best feature thresholds, Extra Trees introduces additional randomness by selecting thresholds at random. This randomness helps in reducing variance, making the model less prone to overfitting, especially in high-dimensional spaces like environmental data.\n",
