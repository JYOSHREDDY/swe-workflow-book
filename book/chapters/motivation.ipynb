    "Accurately predicting Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) is essential for sectors like agriculture, water management, and infrastructure planning. However, traditional methods often fall short, especially as climate change impacts snowpack patterns. Machine Learning (ML) offers a promising solution to improve SWE forecasting, but it comes with challenges. These include dealing with unpredictable data, designing complex workflows, and managing experiment histories. These issues can result in workflows that are hard to replicate or reuse, slowing down progress in SWE research."
