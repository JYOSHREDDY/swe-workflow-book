    "Accurate forecasting of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) is crucial for various sectors including agriculture, water resource management, and infrastructure planning. However, traditional methods often lack precision, especially with climate change causing variations in snowpack. Machine Learning (ML) methodologies offer promising avenues for improving SWE forecasting accuracy, yet their implementation poses significant challenges. These challenges include the randomness in data, complexity of workflow design, and management of experiment histories. Such obstacles often lead to non-reproducible or non-reusable workflows, hindering progress in SWE research and applications."
